/GATES/
NOT - Flips the Qubit
CNOT- Flips Target Qubit if Second qubit is |1>
I- Identity Gate (reflects the Gate symmetrically, i.e. it returns the identical)
H - Creates a Superposition state
X Gate - Change phase on X axis 
Y Gate - change phase on y axis
Z Gate - change phase on z axis 
|0>- Reset- Put the qubit in 0 ket
Meas- Measure 

Create a Superposition State:
-Superposition State of the Cat in the box (either Alive or Dead).

Create an Entanglement State:
-Make the cat Entangled (Both Alive and Dead).

Create an Entangled State
-Put the cat as both Alive and Dead (any probabilites).
