/Story/
Beginning
-"We are entering the Quantum Lab! A place of curiosity, imagination and most importantly CATS!"
-"Looks like were tossing a coin, but wait... its still spinnning..! Why?"
-"This is our first look at Superposition"

Circuit Creation of Superposition 
-"We are going to add some gates which will show you how we make this happen"
-"By adding gates we can see how to create Quantum Properties"
(ADD GATE DESCRIPTORS HERE)

Interference + Entanglement
-"Interference + Entanglement is another key property of Quantum Computing as Matter can be described not just as particles but as WAVES!"
-"We can see this in the water with physical waves"

Circuit Creation of Interference
-"Here is how we can make this phenomenon with circuits"
(ADD GATE DESCRIPTORS HERE)

Noise
-"Another key concept is Noise which current Quantum Computing Research is focused on reducing. Such is Quantum Nature."

Circuit Creation of Noise
-"Here is how we do it"
