/GATES/
NOT - Flips the Qubit
CNOT- Flips Target Qubit if Second qubit is |1>
H - Creates a Superposition state
X Gate - Change phase on X axis 
Y Gate - change phase on y axis
Z Gate - change phase on z axis 
|0>- Put the qubit in 0 ket
Meas X- Measures in X Basis
Meas Y - Measures in Y Basis
Meas- Measures in Z basis

/LEVELS/
Create a Flipped state:
-Flip State from Alive to Dead, dead to Alive 

Create a Bell State
-Make the Cat 50% Alive 50% Dead.

Create an Entangled State 
-Put the cat as both Alive and Dead (any probabilites).
